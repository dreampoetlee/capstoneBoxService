# Capstone Project: Build a Subscription Box Service for Men's Skin Care

## Learning Objective
Use Django REST Framework to build a REST API to serve as the backend for a subscription box company application

## Technologies
Django, Django REST Framework, MySQL, Postman

## User Stories
Box services have sprung up in the last few years to offer a certain category of tailored goods (games, makeup, food/drinks, clothes, etc.) to busy people who don't have the time to search out the individual items themselves. Your mission is to make a website for such a subscription box company, including the following features:

- As a new visitor to the site, I want to be able to enter my info and sign up so I can start receiving regular monthly boxes to my home address.

- As a registered user, I want to take a survey (developer created) about my likes/dislikes so I can be put in a targeted demographic to get the exact box contents that I want.

- As a registered user, I want to be able to choose between three different payment tiers for my box service, with each tier being clearly different with what the contents of the box will be.

- As a registered user, I want an easy way to see how much I owe this month so I can budget accordingly.

- As an administrator user, I want to see an account breakdown: the total amount of accounts, what percentage belong to which demographic, and how much money is being paid monthly overall.

- As an administrator user, I want to see a data visualization (line cart) of the popularity of the different types of box services I offer.

- As a registered user, I want to pay for my monthly subscription using PayPal or Stripe API (sandbox account is fine).

- As a developer, I want to have an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive user interface/user experience (UI/UX) with all features of the application stylized. (CSS, Bootstrap, Material UI, etc.)
